## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Toggle extensions between active and inactive states
- Filter active and inactive extensions
- Remove extensions from the list
- Select their color theme
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Still have their selected color theme and the active and unactive extensions after they reload or leave the page

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flex
- Used my small self-built CSS library
- Custom toggle switch from freefrontend
- JS

### What I learned

First Time actually manipulating DOM elements,implemnting a pre-built elemebt and then editing it, and using localstorage to save the active and unactive extensions, and toggling lightmode. 

### Continued development

I'd like to organinze the code more, decrease the nested if statments, and improving event delegations
